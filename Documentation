A device which scans the objects in its surroundings and makes a mapping of it on your display and guess what its small and cheap!!!




 
Hardware Required
1)	Servo (2x1)
2)	Arduino 
3)	Ultrasonic sensor(1x1)
4)	Breadboard(1x1)
Arduino
Some great masters have developed the Arduino board to help us with our quest. This board will be the heart of the project, so building the project without it would be a harsh journey. We will be using Arduino UNO for this project but any board with at least 9 digital pins is good to go.

For Arduino

// Includes the Servo library
#include <Servo.h>. 
// Defines Tirg and Echo pins of the Ultrasonic Sensor

// Variables for the duration and the distance
long duration;

OUTPUT
 


This is the mapping that we got of an object kept in front of LIDAR, this seems promising isn’t it.
